## List of frameworks

Here a list of frameworks tools have been benchmarked on;

- beego

## Running the benchmark script

Before you run the script, you have to clone the above mentioned libraries and put it on a single folder titled *frameworks*.

## Contribution

The benchmarking is very very basic so if you have gotta some magic lines to improve the evaluation, just fork it and I'm looking forward merging your contribution.
